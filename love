Hello there, Princess,

I hope this finds you with a big smile on your face, just like the smile you give me. I want to tell you that I love you so much, and you really mean a lot to me. To think that it all started from a random comment. I'm so grateful you saw it and even more grateful that you replied. It's incredible how such an insignificant thing like a comment led to a connection like ours.

I love every second we spend together, whether we talk, watch, or play something. Everything we do together is very important to me, and I want our moments to last forever. You give me the most sincere smiles and laughter and truly complete me. 

Thank you for being yourself, thank you for being in my life, and thank you for allowing me to be in your life. I hope our kids will be as beautiful as you are. I can't wait to live together as a family, with a few cats and a big family dog. That is my biggest dream, and I will make it happen.

You always manage to make me feel so comfortable and loved. I've been getting happier and happier since the day I met you, and I'm not the only one who has noticed, my friends have, too. Instead of the usual "meh" as a response to the "how are you?" question, my answer now is either "wonderful" or "amazing," and every time it is because of you. I really hope I can make you feel the way you make me feel.

I normally tend to be hesitant when it comes to opening up to people, but I've always felt safe opening up to you. I love you so much that no combination of words could express it. I love the way we can joke with each other, the way we complete each other. I love your personality, your music taste, your eyes, your lips, your nose, your hair, your hands, your voice. I love everything about you, and I mean everything.

I can't wait for us to meet and do all kinds of TikTok trends together. I want to hug you and never let go. I love you so much, Hania, more than anything else, and I will always love you.

My beautiful, sweet princess! <3
